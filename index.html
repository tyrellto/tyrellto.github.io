    <p>
        Actively exploring research/team-based opportunities in the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare.
    </p>

    <p>
        Passionate about leveraging the transformative power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance healthcare outcomes. With a strong interest in medical imaging, I believe in the potential of AI to revolutionize diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient care. My academic and research experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in both computational methods and their real-world applications in health-tech.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm always open to discussing innovative ideas, potential collaborations, or opportunities in the AI-healthcare domain.
