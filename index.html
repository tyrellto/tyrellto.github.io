    <p>
        I recently graduated from the 5 Year Accelerated Degree Program (4 BS + 1 MS) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Marquette University with Prof. <a href ="https://www.richard.povinelli.org/about"> Richard Povinelli </a> as my primary academic advisor.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my grad and undergrad, I collaborated with Profs. <a href ="https://sites.google.com/view/donghyeye"> Dong Hye Ye </a>, <a href = "https://mcw.marquette.edu/biomedical-engineering/directory/bing-yu.php"> Bing Yu</a> on machine learning and deep learning applications for breast cancer research, specifically for assessment during surgery in a cost-efficient manner.

        <h3><b>RUL Tool Prediction</b></h3>
        <p>Ranked 1st of the class in the Foxconn Industrial AI Data challenge. I focused on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial tools, which was aimed to optimize operational efficiency and reduce unexpected downtime in manufacturing processes.</p>

        <h3><b>Basketball Free Throw Prediction</b></h3>
        <p>This project leverages machine learning to predict the success of basketball free throws based on players' skeletal movements. It's an exploration into the application of data science in sports performance analysis. I was the lead machine learning engineer that orchestrated data collection and model design.</p>
